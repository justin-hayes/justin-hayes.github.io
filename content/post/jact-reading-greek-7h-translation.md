## Translation
So thus a young man, having come across an Amazon alone, at once had sex with
her. And the Amazon did not stop him. And being unable to speak, through signs
she ordered the young man to come on the next day to the same place and bring
another young man, signaling that she will do the same and bring another
Amazon. And the young man, having departed, told this to the others, and on the
next day, upon coming himself to the same place, leading another young man, came
upon the Amazon herself, leading another Amazon. The two young men, upon finding
the Amazons and having sex with them, departed. The rest of the young men, upon
learning what had happened, themselves also did the same.

After this the Scythians and the Amazons lived together. The men were not able
to learn the language of the Amazons, but the women learned the language of the
Scythians. Finally the young men said to them: "We have parents and possessions.
So why don't we return to our people? And we will have you as wives and not
others." But they to this said, "We are not able to live with your women. For
our customs are not the same as the customs of the Scythians. For we use bows
and arrows, and ride horses, and we did not learn the work of women. Your women
do none of this, but perform the work of women, waiting in their wagons and not
using bows and arrows nor riding horses. But if you want to have us as wives,
upon going to your parents you must obtain your share of the possessions
and then upon returning live together with us."

Upon saying this<sup>1</sup> they persuaded the young men. So the young men, upon obtaining
their share of the possessions, returned again to the Amazons. So the Amazons said
to them: "But we have a great fear<sup>2</sup>. For we do not want to live in this land,
having laid waste to the earth. But if you want to have us as wives, why don't
we get up and go off out of this land, and once across the Tanais river, dwell
there?" And the young men also obeyed this. So upon getting up, going off, and
arriving at the region, they dwelled there.

1. [ταῦτα](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dtau%3Dta) is plural ("these things").
2. Subject and object are mistakenly reversed here: "A great fear holds us."
