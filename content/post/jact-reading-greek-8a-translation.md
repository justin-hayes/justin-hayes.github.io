The story returns to Dikaiopolis and the rhapsode as they leave the chaotic scene at the Piraeus and the Long Walls, heading towards the center of Athens.<!--more-->
## Translation
_Dikaiopolis, having seen the lawlessness of the Eleven and heard the words of the suppliant, departs through the crowd of citizens towards the agora with the rhapsode. And Euelpides, the son of Polemarkhos, sees him going off towards the agora with the rhapsode, and on seeing them he sends his slave to them. So the slave of Euelpides comes toward Dikaiopolis, and approaching he shouts._

__Slave__: Wait, Dikaiopolis, wait!

__Dikaiopolis__: What is that shout? Who is responsible for that shout?

_(The slave, having approached, takes hold of his cloak.)_

__Slave__: I am responsible for the shouts.

__Dikaiopolis__: Who is it that holds my cloak, fellow?

__Slave__: I am a slave.

__Dikaiopolis__: But whose slave do you happen to be? Who sent you?

__Slave__: I am Euelpides's slave, and he happened to send me. For Euelpides son of
Polemarkhos greets you.

__Dikaiopolis__: But where is he?

__Slave__: Here he is coming behind. Do you not see him running through the crowd of
citizens? And with him a friend is following, Peisetairos, Stilbonides's son. It
is clear that for your sake he is running. But wait.

__Dikaiopolis__: We are waiting<sup>1</sup>.

_(Euelpides runs towards them, holding a basket in his hand. Reaching Dikaiopolis before Peisetairos<sup>2</sup>, Euelpides takes hold of his hand and greets him.)_

__Euelpides__: Greetings, friend Dikaiopolis! Where are you going, and where did you
come from?

__Dikaiopolis__: From the Piraeus, my very good friend. I happen to be approaching
the assembly, for the assembly will become sovereign today.<sup>3</sup>

_(Meanwhile, Peisetairos happens to be approaching, holding a crow on his hand.)_

__Dikaiopolis__: And greetings also to you, Peisetairos. Where are you going with
that crow? Surely not _to_ the crows?

__Peisetairos__: Of course, for we are getting up and leaving from our home country.

__Dikaiopolis__: But why are you wanting to leave in this way? Won't you please tell
me? For I would listen with very much pleasure to the reason.

__Euelpides__: I will tell you. For we search for a place free from trouble. We will
go there, and having come there we will dwell in a city free from trouble.

__Dikaiopolis__: But why are you wanting to carry that crow on your hand?

__Peisetairos__: This crow leads, and we follow. For who is a better leader
_to_ the crows _than_ the crow?

__Rhapsode__: The crow is indeed the best leader.
## Comments
1. "We _will_ wait" is the correct translation. The independent study guide notes the difference between περιμενοῦμεν and περιμένομεν--the former is in the future tense, and given that the stem end in ν, it becomes an ε-contract verb (περιμενέομεν -> περιμενοῦμεν). 
2. The reading uses [φθάνω](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aentry%3Dfqa%2Fnw) to suggest an event that happens "before" another event, i.e. Euelpides reaches and greets Dikaiopolis before Peisetairos. In previous readings φθάνω was used to mean "anticipates \<some action> by \<doing some other action>."
3. The [ἐκκλησία](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesia_(ancient_Athens)) was a democratic council that originally met once per month.
