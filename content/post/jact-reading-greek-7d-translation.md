Socrates goes to the Lyceum and finds two sophists, Euthydemos and Dionysodoros, speaking among those assembled. He volunteers one of his young students, Kleinias, to engage the sophists in philosophical dialogue.<!--more-->
## Translation
Yesterday I went to the Lykeion<sup>1</sup>, Kriton, and came upon Euthydemos and
Dionysodoros conversing with many others. And you at least<sup>2</sup> know both of the men,
that have fine reputations, since they urge people to philosophy. So I was
wanting to hear their words<sup>3</sup>:

"You then," I said, "Dionysodorus, do you have a reputation of urging people to
philosophy and virtue, or not?"

"Indeed we have that reputation<sup>4</sup>, Socrates", he said.

"Well", I said, "then you are obligated to urge this young man to philosophy and
virtue. They call him Kleinias. He is young. Why not closely question the young
man, conversing here in front of us?"

Euthydemos at once bravely answered: "Indeed we wish<sup>5</sup> to converse here, Socrates,
but the young man is obligated to answer."

"The fact is that", I said, "Kleinias enjoys answering. For often friends
approach him questioning and conversing, and always he speaks and answers when
they question.

And Euthydemos said, "Then listen, Kleinias, and upon hearing, answer."

Kleinias said, "I will do this, and I will answer. For I enjoy answering. So
speak, Euthydemos, and closely question me. Of course the sophist through
speaking and closely questioning urges his students to virtue."

And Euthydemos said, "So tell me, which are the learned ones<sup>6</sup>, the wise<sup>7</sup> or the
ignorant?"

And the young man--for the question happened to be great--was at a loss. Being
at a loss, he looked at me and blushed.

Upon seeing him blushing, I said, "Don't worry and don't be afraid, but bravely
answer."

And at this Dionysodorus laughed, and with a laugh he said, "Look here, I know
well that Euthydemos defeated<sup>8</sup> him with speaking<sup>9</sup>."

And I did not answer. For Kleinias, while Dionysodorus was saying these things,
happened to answer that the wise are the learned ones.<sup>10</sup>
## Comments
1. Lykeion (Λύκειον) is more typically rendered into English as [Lyceum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyceum_(Classical)).
2. The independent study guide leaves the particle [γε](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aentry%3Dge) untranslated, which reads more naturally than assuming the "limiting" meaning.
3. [λόγος](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aentry%3Dlo%2Fgos) is more suitably translated "arguments" in the context of philosophical discourse. The sentence ἐγὼ οὖν τοὺς ἐκείνων λόγους ἀκούειν βουλόμενος... ἦν δ' ἐγώ... is rendered more naturally as "So, wanting to hear their arguments, I said, ..."
4. The meaning of [δοκέω](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aentry%3Ddoke%2Fw) was elided here--better rendered as "Indeed we seem to, Socrates..."
5. The independent study guide gives the "we are willing" meaning for [βουλόμεθα](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aentry%3Dbou%2Flomai), which I prefer more than "want" or "wish."
6. The independent study guide gives "people who learn" for οἱ μανθάνοντες, which aligns better than "learned ones" with the argument that Euthydemos will attempt to make.
7. The independent study guide gives "clever" for οἱ σοφοί, for the same reason.
8. The tense is incorrect here--νικήσει is future third person singular ("Euthydemos will defeat him").
9. The independent study guide gives λέγων as "in discussion," which reads more naturally.
10. As in 6 and 7, the independent study guide gives "the people who learn are the clever ones."
