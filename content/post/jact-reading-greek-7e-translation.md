Continuing the dialogue, Euthydemos leads Kleinias to contradict his previous statement that the clever are the ones who learn, not the ignorant.<!--more-->
## Translation
And Euthydemos said, "But who teaches the ones who learn, the teacher, or
someone else?"

He \[Kleinias\] agreed that the teacher teaches the ones who learn.

"And when the teacher taught you as children, you were students?"

He agreed.

"And when you were students, you knew nothing yet?"

"No, by Zeus. For being students, we knew nothing."

"So, were you clever, not knowing anything?"

"Indeed we were not clever", said Kleinias, "since we did not know anything."

"Therefore if you were not clever, then you were ignorant?"

"Certainly."

"Then you, being students, did not know anything, but though ignorant you were
learning?"

The young man agreed.

"Then the ignorant learn, Kleinias, but not the clever, that you know<sup>1</sup>."
