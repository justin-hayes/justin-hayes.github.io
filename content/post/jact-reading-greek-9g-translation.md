## Translation
__Bdelykleon__: Does everything please you, father? Tell me.

__Philokleon__: Indeed everything pleases me, you know well.

__Bdelykleon__: Therefore sit, father. Look: I summon the first lawsuit.

__Philokleon__: Don't summon the lawsuit, son, but listen.

__Bdelykleon__: Alright, I'm listening. What are you saying? Come, father; speak!

__Philokleon__: Where are the voting urns? For I am not able to cast the vote
without voting urns, you know well.

_(The old man begins to run out)_

__Bdelykleon__: (shouting after him)

Hey, to where are you hurrying?

__Philokleon__: I am running out for the sake of the voting urns!

__Bdelykleon__: Don't go away in any way, but obey me and listen, father.

__Philokleon__: _(looking back over his shoulder)_

But son, I must search for the voting urns to cast the vote. Leave off!

_(again he begins to run out)_

__Bdelykleon__: _(points to some cups)_

Stop running out, father, since I happen to have these cups. So don't go away.

__Philokleon__: _(satisfied)_

Fine! For all of the things of the court are present--

_(has a sudden thought)_

Except...

__Bdelykleon__: What thing?

__Philokleon__: Except the water clock. Where is the water clock? Fetch it for me.

__Bdelykleon__: Look!

_(He shows his father's chamber pot)_

Say, what is this? Do you not think this chamber pot is the best water clock?
Now everything is present.

_(Sosias enters, leading two dogs. It seems that one, Labes (Λάβης, "Grabber") has wolfed a whole cheese. It is decided that the other dog should charge him with theft. Bdelykleon orders the slaves to clear the "courtroom" and asks for ritual prayers.)_

__Bdelykleon__: So sit, father, and stop worrying. Listen, slaves, and obey me, and
fetch out the fire.

And pray to all the gods, and having prayed, prosecute.

_(Having fetched out the fire, all the slaves departed, and those present pray to the gods.)_
