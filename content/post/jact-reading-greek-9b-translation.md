Xanthias and Sosias solicit audience participation as they reveal more about the nature of the "beast" that they guard.<!--more-->
## Translation
__Xanthias__: For we have a master there<sup>1</sup>, the one above sleeping quietly. Can you
not see him sleeping?

_(points up to the roof)_

So we have this master. And the master has a father who is very old. The master
ordered us to guard the father, and we obeyed him ordering. For the master fell
into a state of perplexity about his father, when he realized that he was more
wicked than the others in the city, and the cause of many evils. For the father
of the master has a disease. So I ask you, spectators, what happens to be the
name to this disease? You give the answer to us asking. Come now: what does this
man say?

__Sosias__: This man here is answering to us that he thinks the old man is a lover
of dice. But I say to the man that clearly he is speaking nonsense, giving
answers of this kind. Nonetheless "love" is the beginning of the evil.

__Xanthias__: For the old man loves something. But what does this man say?

__Sosias__: This man answers me, having asked, that he thinks the father to be a
lover of sacrifices or a lover of strangers.

__Xanthias__. By the dog, my dear chap, he is not loving strangers, since Philoxenos
is a homosexual<sup>2</sup>.
## Comments
1. This section introduces the dative as an alternative to the genitive when describing possession. The independent study guide gives "That is our master there" for ἔστιν γὰρ ἡμῖν δεσπότης ἐκεινοσί--the most literal translation is "There is to us a master there." The essential feature is the verb "to be" with the possessing side of the relationship in the dative case.
2. This joke is a pun on [φιλόξενος](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aentry%3Dfilo%2Fcenos), an adjective composed of "loving" and "stranger," meaning hospitable, and [Φιλόξενος](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philoxenus_of_Cythera), a contempary of [Aristophanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristophanes) and a subject of his parody.
