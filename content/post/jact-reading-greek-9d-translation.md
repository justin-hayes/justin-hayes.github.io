## Translation
__Bdelykleon__: 

_(shouting to the slaves from the roof)_

Xanthias and Sosias, are you sleeping?

__Xanthias__: Alas, unhappy me!

__Sosias__: What is it?

__Xanthias__: The master no longer sleeps but is getting up and shouting.

__Sosias__: But to whom is the man speaking?

__Xanthias__: Bdelykleon is saying something to us, as it seems to me. And chancing
upon us sleeping the master will kill us.

__Sosias__: He seems to me too to be saying something, Xanthias. But what are you
intending by getting up, master?

__Bdelykleon__:

_(pointing inside the house)_

What? Supposedly my father is keeping quiet, but in fact he wants to get out.
And my father is always brazenly<sup>1</sup> wanting to get out. Now it seems to me at
least, my father entered the oven and looks for a hole with much urgency.

_(looking at the chimney)_

Lord Poseidon, why ever then is the chimney making a noise?

_(Philokleon comes out of the chimney)_

Hey, who are you?

__Philokleon__: I am smoke coming out of the chimney.

__Bdelykleon__: Smoke? You are not like smoke coming out, it seems to me, but more like Philokleon. What does it seem to you, Xanthias?

__Xanthias__: He seems to me to be more like to no one than Philokleon, master.

__Bdelykleon__: So here he looks<sup>2</sup> for some other scheme.

1. [τόλμῃ](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aentry%3Dto%2Flma) [χρῆται](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aentry%3Dxra%2Fomai)--dative of use, "using audacity."
2. [ζήτει](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aentry%3Dzhte%2Fw) is the imperative second person singular--the independent study guide gives "So here, look for some other scheme." I misread it as the nominative third person singular, which would have been ζητεῖ.
