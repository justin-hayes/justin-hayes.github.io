The Amazons suffer losses in fighting with the Greeks, but the survivors escape their captors and sail to Scythia. They skirmish with the Scythians, but the Scythians, upon learning that the Amazons are women, have other plans for the invaders than driving them out by force.<!--more-->
## Translation
When the Greeks, falling upon the Amazons, fought with them, they defeated them
in battle. And upon defeating them, they captured the Amazons who survived the
battle. And upon taking them, they departed in three ships. However, they did not
arrive at their homeland. For since they were at sea, they did not guard the
Amazons. The Amazons, upon seeing the men were not guarding them, killed them.
But the Amazons were not experienced regarding naval matters. Therefore, having
killed the men, they sailed just where the wind carried them.

Finally, they arrived in the land of the Scythians, and upon disembarking from
the ships they came upon a herd of horses. Having taken the horses, they laid
waste to the land of the Scythians. The Scythians, not knowing the language and
thinking that the Amazons were men, attacked and fought the Amazons and took up
corpses. So thus, upon taking up corpses, they learned the Amazons were women.

Upon learning this, they did not want to still kill them, but to beget children
by them, and sent off their own young men to them, ordering them not to
fight, but to follow and and make camp near the Amazons. So the young men, upon
coming nearby, followed and made camp. And at first the Amazons went away, and
upon going away they saw the young men following. So the Amazons pursued them,
and the men fled. Upon seeing the fleeing men, the Amazons fell silent. So thus
having learned that the men were not hostile, they no longer worried about them.
