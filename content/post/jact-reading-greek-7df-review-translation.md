Socrates explores whether or not the opinions of the many are as valuable as those with experience.<!--more-->
## Translation
"So you, Socrates," I said, "you question, and I will answer."

"Then consider," said Socrates, "and if you are able<sup>1</sup> to object, object, and I will obey."

"I think that you seem to speak beautifully," I said.

"Well then, " he said, "does he speak the truth, the philosopher that says you
must not praise all the opinions of men? What do you say? Does he seem to speak
the truth, saying this, or not? Answer."

"The truth," I said.

"Therefore we must<sup>2</sup> praise and honor the good opinions, and not the bad?"

I agreed.

"Come then," said Socrates, "when the plague fell upon and destroyed the city,
where did you go, to your friends, or to the doctor?"

"I went to the doctor," I said, "and my friends also went there. For the
doctor knew about the plague, having more expertise than the others."

"Indeed the doctor seemed to be the most experienced," said Socrates. "So you
were obligated to go to the doctor, and no one else?"

"I was obligated," I said.

"Then regarding the plague we must not praise and respect the opinions of the many,
but of the doctors, if some one happens to be the most experienced?<sup>3</sup> Do we say<sup>4</sup> thus,
or not?"

"Yes, we say thus, by Zeus," I said.
## Comment
1. The independent study guide gives "and if you have anything" for καὶ εἴ τι ἔχεις.
2. The ISG gives "should" for [δεῖ](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aentry%3Ddei%3D) in several places.
3. The ISG gives a meaning closer to "...if any skilled doctor happens to be [available]" for εἴ τις ἐμπeιρότατος τυγχάνει ὤν. 
4. The ISG gives the sense of "we agree" for [φάμεν](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aentry%3Dfhmi%2F).
