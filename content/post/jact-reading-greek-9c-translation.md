Xanthias takes pity on the audience and tells them the true nature of the old man's illness.<!--more-->
## Translation
__Xanthias__: You will never find out the answer, spectators. If indeed you want to
know what sickness has befallen his father, be silent now. For I will tell to you, who are indeed in perplexity, the old man's illness. He is a lover of being a
juror like no other man. For he is always judging lawsuits and loves the
lawcourt, during the day sitting in the lawcourt but during the night dreaming
of lawsuits. Furthermore the lovers write on a door "beautiful Demos", but he
seeing and coming nearby writes alongside, "beautiful funnel."<sup>1</sup> So we are
guarding this man with these bars that are shutting him in<sup>2</sup>, being many and large. For
his son, when he learned that his father was a lover of the lawcourts, finding the
sickness hard to bear, at first tried to persuade him not to go out of
doors, saying as follows:

"Why," he said, "are you always judging lawsuits, father, in the lawcourt? Will
you not stop being a juror? Will you not stop<sup>3</sup> for your son?"

But the father did not obey him that was trying to persuade him not to go out.
Then the son introduced his father into the Korybantic<sup>4</sup> rites. The father, having
fallen into the lawcourt, judged with drum and all. From then on we guarded him
locked away inside with these nets. The old man's name is Philokleon, but the<sup>5</sup> 
son's name is Bdelykleon.
## Comments
1. Firstly, subject followed by adjective implies "is"--"Demos is beautiful" and "funnel is beautiful." Demos in this case is the name of the man, rhyming with [κημὸς](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aentry%3Dkhmo%2Fs), the device used to cast votes.
2. τοῦτον οὖν φυλάττομεν τούτοις τοῖς μοχλοῖς ἐγκλείσαντες, πολλοῖς τε οὖσι καὶ μεγάλοις--the independent study guide gives "So we are guarding this man, having shut him in with these bars which are many and big." The aorist plural nominative participle ἐγλκείσαντες agrees with the implied subject "we," which is clearer in the ISG translation. The present plural dative participle οὖσι agrees with and describes the bars.
3. [πείσῃ](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aentry%3Dpei%2Fqw) is the singular future tense of πείθομαι--thus, "Will you not obey your son?"
4. The [Korybantes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korybantes)--perhaps the son's attempt at distraction or therapy for his father.
5. The τούτῳ emphasises _this_ son.
