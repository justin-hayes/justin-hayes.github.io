## Translation
_In front of the house are two slaves. At first they are conversing with each other, then to the audience._

__Sosias__: Hey, what is the matter with you?

_(again, louder)_

Hey, what is the matter with you?

_(louder still)_

I am talking to you, Xanthias!

__Xanthias__: _(wakes up with a start)_ What is the shouting?

_(sees Sosias)_

What are you saying, Sosias?<sup>1</sup> What do you hope to achieve shouting in this way?
You will be the death of me with this shouting!

__Sosias__: I am talking to you, unlucky Xanthias, and it is for your sake that I
use a shout. But what is the matter with you? 

__Xanthias__: Sleeping pleasurably.

__Sosias__: You are sleeping? But I would like to say something to you, ill-favored
man that you are, and unlucky. 
 
__Xanthias__: What would you like to say to me?

__Sosias__: I would like to say to you that a great evil will befall you. For the
master will kill you. So don't sleep. Do you not happen to know what sort of
beast we are guarding?

__Xanthias__: I think I know.

__Sosias__: But these spectators here do not know. So recite the words of the drama to the
members of the audience, being many indeed.

__Xanthias__: Well then, I will recite to the crowd of spectators the words of our play.
