Euelpides and Peisetairos explain the conditions in Athens and what has befallen them such that they want to flee the city.<!--more-->
## Translation
__Dikaiopolis__: So you look for a greater city than Athens?

__Euelpides__: No by Zeus, that is not what I intend. No city is greater than
this city. For by Zeus Athens seems<sup>1</sup> to be the greatest.

__Rhapsode__: Then you look for a city wealthier than this city?

__Euelpides__: No city is not more wealthy than this city. For Athens is the
wealthiest city.

__Dikaiopolis__: So what then? What do you have in mind? Surely you do not hate the
city?

__Peisetairos__: No by Zeus we do not hate this city<sup>2</sup>.

__Dikaiopolis__: So tell me, friends, what did you suffer or what is your intention
in emigrating from the city?

__Euelpides__: Indeed something terrible happened to Peisetairos and I, Dikaiopolis,
and we want to leave. For we find hard to bear the troubles of this city, and
especially the law-courts. For such we suffered upon entering the law-courts.

__Rhapsode__: What sort of suffering? What were you doing or what crimes were you
committing that you experienced this suffering?

__Euelpides__: We neither did anything nor committed any crime, but the jurors
condemned us, though we were innocent, because of the false testimony of the
witnesses.

__Dikaiopolis__: I am not surprised if you are getting up, leaving, and
searching for some other city, when you speak justly about the law-courts and
the jurors. For the cicadas sing for a short while on their branches, but the
Athenians are always singing in their lawsuits. So you are reasonable in doing
this. But I can not reasonably do this<sup>3</sup>. For I am patriotic, like the orators,
and I will never cease being patriotic.

__Peisetairos__: Dikaiopolis, what are you saying? Surely you do not consider the
orators to be patriotic?

__Dikaiopolis__: I do. Why not?

__Peisetairos__: But how do the orators love the deme<sup>4</sup>? For look around. The war
takes its course, everywhere there are lamentations and funeral pyres
because of the plague, and everywhere corpses, and much lawlessness. Do the
orators pity this deme? Or do they not pity it? Tell me. Why are you
silent? Will you not say? They do not pity it, but they will destroy the city,
you know that well. For I will answer for you. The land is full of the
brazenness of the orators, and full the assembly, and full the law-courts, but
the deme is full of loss.
## Comments
1. The independent study guide gives "clearly" as the meaning for [φαίνονται](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=fai/nomai&la=greek#lexicon).
2. The ISG gives "the city itself" for αὐτὴν τὴν πόλιν, more clearly emphasizing that Euelpides and Peisetairos do not hate their home, but what has become of the institutions.
3. More correctly "I _will_ not reasonably do this"--[ποιήσω](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=poih/sw&la=greek#lexicon) being in the future tense.
4. The ISG gives "the people" for [δῆμος](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aentry%3Ddh%3Dmos), in ancient Athens a [unit of political organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deme).
