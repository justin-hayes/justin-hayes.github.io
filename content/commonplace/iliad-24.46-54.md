> A man may have lost one dearer even than this man was--a brother, whom the same mother bore, or perhaps a son; yet surely when he has wept and wailed for him he makes an end; for an enduring heart have the Fates given to men. But this man, when he has robbed noble Hector of life, binds him behind his chariot and drags him about the mound of his dear comrade; surely neither honor nor profit will he have of this. Let him beware lest we grow angry with him, valiant though he is; for in his fury he disfigures the mute earth.

(p. 567)
