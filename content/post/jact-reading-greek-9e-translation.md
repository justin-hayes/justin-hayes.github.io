Philokleon enjoys a moment of freedom thanks to a plan inspired by Homer.<!--more-->
## Translation
__Philokleon__: (commandingly)

But open the door!

__Bdelykleon__: (resolutely)

By Poseidon, father, never!

__Philokleon__: (a pause, then craftily)

But today is the first of the month.<sup>1</sup>

__Bdelykleon__: This man devises some great evil, so it seems to me. What do you
think, Xanthias?

__Xanthias__: It also seems so to me.

__Philokleon__: (overhears)

By Zeus, no indeed, but I will go out, since I want to sell the mule in the
market-place, pack-saddle and all.

__Bdelykleon__: You want to sell the mule, pack-saddle and all? But I am able to do
this.

__Philokleon__: But I am able to do this better than you.

__Bdelykleon__: No, by Zeus, I could do it better than you!

__Philokleon__: But go in and bring out the mule.

(The mule is led out of the courtyard)

__Bdelykleon__: What have you suffered that you are groaning, mule? Is it that today
we will sell you? Don't groan any longer, mule. What is the matter? Why are you
groaning, if you are not carrying an Odysseus<sup>2</sup>?

__Sosias__: (looks under the mule)

But yes, by Zeus, he is at least carrying someone here underneath.

__Bdelykleon__: The mule is carrying someone? Whoever are you, fellow?

__Philokleon__: Nobody, by Zeus.

__Bdelykleon__: You are Nobody? From which country are you?

__Philokleon__: Ithacan, the son of Runawayhorse<sup>3</sup>.

__Bdelykleon__: (to Sosias)

Drag him out from underneath.

(looks at Philokleon in digust)

Oh most foul man, for I know you are the most wicked of all men. For my father
is indeed most like Odysseus, so it seems to me. But father, push the mule and
yourself into the house with all urgency.

(points to a pile of stones)

And you, Sosias, push with your hands many of the stones towrd the door.

__Sosias__: (busies himself with the task. Suddenly...)

Alas, unhappy me! What is this? From whereever did this clod of earth fall upon
me?

__Xanthias__: (points to the roof)

Look, master, the man is becoming a sparrow.

__Bdelykleon__: Alas, I am unfortunate. For my father does not escape my notice in
becoming a sparrow. But we will anticipate his escape.<sup>4</sup> Where oh where is my net?
Shoo, shoo, back, shoo!

(he chases his father with the net)

__Sosias__: (with relief, determined that the old man will give no more trouble)

Come then. Since we have shut him in, the old man will no longer cause trouble
to us shutting him in and being his guards, nor will he escape our notice in
running away... why don't we sleep a little while?
## Comments
1. Per the independent study guide, the first of the month was traditionally a market day.
2. [Odysseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odysseus) uses similar means to escape from the cyclops [Polyphemus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphemus#The_Classical_accounts) in the [Odyssey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odyssey).
3. Ἀποδρασιππίδης--A slapstick name invented for comedy.
4. The subject and object are incorrectly reversed here. ἀλλὰ φθήσεται ἡμᾶς ἐκφυγών is "But he will anticipate us by escaping,"--evident from a more careful reading of the verb in combination with the accusative case.
