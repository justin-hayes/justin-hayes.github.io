A brief synopsis of the preceding readings about the Amazons.<!--more-->
## Translation
Some Amazons, on arriving in the land of the Scythians and departing their
ships, fell upon the land and laid waste to it. The Scythians, on defeating 
them in battle, took up corpses and, on learning that they were women, wanted to
have children by the Amazons. So they ordered the young men to never fight, but
on coming nearby, to become friends, and they sent them away to the Amazons. The
Amazons, on seeing them nearby and following, but never fighting, were no longer
worried about them. Then a Scythian, having come across an Amazon who was alone and becoming
friends, ordered the others to do the same, and on finding some Amazons, to become
friends. So the others obeyed, and finally the Scythians and the Amazons lived
together. But the Amazons did not want to return to the Scythian people. "For we
are not able", they said, "to live together with your women. For our customs and
the customs of the Scythians are not the same." So having taken their
possessions and crossing the river, they found a place nearby and dwelled there.
