When Euthydemos concludes his argument, Dionysodorus makes the case for the contradiction.<!--more-->
## Translation
So said Euthydemos. And the students, at the same time both making a din
and with laughter, praised this wisdom<sup>1</sup>. And like a ball Dionysodoros at once
received the argument in turn, and on receiving it, he said:

"And why, Kleinias? Let's suppose the teacher says some arguments. Who learns
the arguments, the clever or the ignorant ones?

"The clever," Kleinias said.

"Then the clever learn, but not the ignorant, and you did not just answer well."

And from then making a din and with laughter, the students at once praised this
wisdom. And we, falling into perplexity, were silent.
## Comment
The independent study guide consistently translates [σοφία](<insert link>) as cleverness, which better matches the playful tone of these dialogues.
